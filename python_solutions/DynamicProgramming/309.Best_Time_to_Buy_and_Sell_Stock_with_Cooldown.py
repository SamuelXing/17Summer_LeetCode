 The key for dp is to find the variables to represent the states and deduce the transition function.
 
 Three states in this states: buy, sell, cooldown
 buy[i]: the maximum profit for any sequence ends with buy before ith day 
 sell[i]: the maximum profit for any sequence ends with sell before ith day 
 cooldown[i]: the maximum profit for any sequence ends with rest before ith day 

 #1, solution
 buy[i] = max(rest[i-1]-prices, buy[i-1])
 sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+prices, sell[i-1])
 cooldown = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1]) ??

 #2, furthure observation
 rest[i] = sell[i-1]
